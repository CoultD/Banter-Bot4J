With this in mind, a simple equation is made to determine the base power of the attack Base Power = 110 * (Opponent's Current HP / Opponent's Max HP) So for example if we were battling a Max IV'd, Max EV'd Torterra at Level 100 and it had just over half its HP remaining, it would be as such Base Power = 110 * (215 / 394) = 60.03 (2 d.p.)

With this in mind, a simple equation is made to determine the base power of the attack Base Power = 110 * (Opponent's Current HP / Opponent's Max HP) So for example if we were battling a Max IV'd, Max EV'd Torterra at Level 100 and it had just over half its HP remaining, it would be as such Base Power = 110 * (215 / 394) = 60.03 (2 d.p.)
