However, due to this, its special items; Metal Powder & Quick Powder will stop working, and all other species items may work if you transform into the correct species. For example, if you had a Ditto with a Light Ball and you transformed into a Pikachu. the Light Ball would increase Ditto's Attack & Special Attack stats. Also, the EV training that you have put on Ditto becomes void for this battle. However, that said, when Critical Hits happen, it will still be based upon Ditto/Mew's stats. As the Pokémon's catch rate changes, if you wish to capture a Ditto or a Mew (Level 30 in Emerald will know Transform, although it isn't too likely to use it) with greater ease, then send in a Pokémon with a high capture rate such as Magikarp in battle first and then it should be very simple to capture.
